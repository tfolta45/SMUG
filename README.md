Selected Models User Guided

I just uploaded an Rshiny Demo for dynamic UI. Basically the output changes via what is selected by the user. We can use this as a framework for our app. We can structure datasets for the specific "variable situation" selected and then make the plot command reactive to handle each different data type.
